 he monthly payment on a loan may be calculated by the following formula:
 payment = (rate(1+rate)^n/(1+Rrate)^n - 1) * L
 
 Rate is the monthly interest rate, which is the annual interest rate divided by 12. (A 12 percent annual interest would be 1 percent monthly interest.)

 N is the number of payments

 L is the amount of the loan.

 Write a program that asks for these values and displays a report similar to the following:

  

     Loan Amount:                                 $  10000.00

     Monthly Interest Rate:                                    1%

     Number of Payments:                                     36

     Monthly Payment:                        $       332.14

     Amount Paid Back:                       $   11957.15

     Interest Paid:                                    $     1957.15
 */
