 A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the sales for the month and the amount of sales tax collected. Write a program that asks for the month, the year, and the total amount collected at the cash register (that is, sales plus sales tax).

 Assume the state sales tax is 4 percent and the county sales tax is 2 percent.

 If the total amount collected is known and the total sales tax is 6 percent, the amount of product sales may be calculated as: S = T/1.06
 S is the product sales and T is the total income (product sales plus sales tax).

 The program should display a report similar to

 County Sales Tax:                  $        501.38

 State Sales Tax:                       $      1002.75

 Total Sales Tax:                        $      1504.13
